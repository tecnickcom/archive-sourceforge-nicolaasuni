Description:
	TMXResourceBundle is a PHP5 class to read text resources directly from a TMX file.
	
	TMX (Translation Memory eXchange - http://www.lisa.org/tmx/) is the vendor-neutral open XML standard for the exchange of Translation Memory (TM) data created by Computer Aided Translation (CAT) and localization tools. The purpose of TMX is to allow easier exchange of translation memory data between tools and/or translation vendors with little or no loss of critical data during the process. In existence since 1998, TMX is a certifiable standard format. TMX is developed and maintained by OSCAR (Open Standards for Container/Content Allowing Re-use - http://www.lisa.org/oscar), a LISA Special Interest Group (http://www.lisa.org/).
	
	One of the main concerns of internationalization consists of separating the main source code from the texts, the labels, the messages and all the other objects related to the specific language in use. This facilitates the translation process as such as all the resources related to the local language context are well identified and separated.
	
	In a global market the costs to translate and update the texts (including labels, messages, menu elements and so on) can easily become quite high. This is the context where the TMX standard comes to help by applying to the translation and management process of these texts the concepts of reuse, increase of consistency, and the shortening of the production cycle. All this with the added bonus of cutting the development costs.
